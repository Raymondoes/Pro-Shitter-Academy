      Pro shitter Nan shows you his cool shitwork, anyone who wants to join will go through shit training in order to join the company but the CEO himself who is Nan does not allow LGBTQ people to join the company and whoever joins the company as an LGBTQ member will be paid 0.1$ per year, Nan's pro shitting Academy will pay the straight ones 100$ per week, Nan is one of the best Pro Shitters even while sweating like shit in The Strongest Battlegrounds.
